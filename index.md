# Hi, I'm Alex

I'm a Quant Trader for almost 3 years now. I've always had an interest in machine learning and generally understanding why things happen and how we can model them. I've been fortunate that this skillset has been highly relevant at my work, but I am still looking to expand my horizons across the modern advent of advanced, highly data driven models that I believe have the potential to change the world, for better or for worse.

Always disliked the term black-box and always a big believer of Laplace's demon.
